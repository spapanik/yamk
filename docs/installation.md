# Installation

# Using uv

We recommend using [uv] for the installation of `yam` as it provides
an isolated environment for the package, preventing any dependency conflicts.

The minimum python version needed is `3.10` but as uv is used, version 3.13
is preferred.

To install `yam` using uv, run the following command in your terminal:

```console
$ uv tool install --python 3.13 yam
```
