Installation
============

The easiest way is to use `pipx`_ to install ``yam``.

.. code:: console

   $ pipx install yamk

Alternatively, you can install it with `pip`_:

.. code:: console

   $ pip install --user yamk

The biggest issue with this approach is that you won't have an isolated
environment for ``yam``, therefore you might run into dependency conflicts,
and so this is neither recommended nor supported.
